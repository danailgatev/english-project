			<h2>Research on School and Education</h2> 
			<p class="subtitle">
				A short research based on answers from 8th grade students
			</p>
			<p>
				School and education are very important parts of students’ lives. 
				They help young people learn new things, build skills, and prepare for the future. 
				The aim of this research is to present the opinions of 8th grade students from Sofia Mathematical High School 
				about school subjects, foreign languages, and the role of school in real life.
				The research is based on answers from 20 students from different profiles. 
				Some students study mathematics and informatics, others are in physics profiles, there are German language classes, 
				and a small group of students are more interested in natural sciences like chemistry and biology. 
				The research focuses on three main questions related to school and education.

			<h3>Most Important School Subjects</h3>
			<p>
				Mathematics is the most important subject for most students. 
				Seventeen out of twenty students (85%) included mathematics in their top three subjects. 
				They say that mathematics helps them think logically, solve problems, and understand other subjects like physics, informatics, and chemistry. 
				Informatics and Information Technologies were chosen by fourteen students (70%). 
				Students explain that programming and computer skills are very important in the modern world and will be useful in many future jobs. 
				Physics was chosen by thirteen students (65%), mainly by students from physics profiles. 
				They believe that physics helps them understand natural laws and how the world works. 
				Foreign languages were included in the top three by thirteen students (65%). 
				English is mentioned most often, but German is also important because of the language profiles in the school. 
				Bulgarian Language and Literature was chosen by twelve students (60%). 
				Students say that this subject helps them express their ideas better and understand texts more deeply. 
				Chemistry and biology were mentioned by a smaller but clear group of students. 
				Five students (25%) included chemistry and/or biology in their top three subjects. 
				These students are more interested in natural sciences and explain that chemistry and biology help them understand life, health, and the structure of matter. 
				Some of them say they are interested in medicine, pharmacy, or scientific research in the future.

			<h3>Importance of Foreign Languages</h3>
			<p>
				All twenty students (100%) say that learning foreign languages in high school is very important. 
				There is no student who thinks that languages are not useful. 
				English is the most important foreign language according to fourteen students (70%). 
				They explain that English is used everywhere: in technology, science, the internet, and communication with people from other countries. 
				Many students say that most programming languages, websites, and learning materials are in English. 
				German is also very important, especially in Sofia Mathematical High School. 
				Eight students (40%) say that German is very useful. 
				Students from German language classes believe that knowing German can help them study or work in countries like Germany, Austria, or Switzerland. 
				They also say that German is important for engineering and technical education. 
				Seven students (35%) think that learning two foreign languages is a big advantage. 
				They believe that knowing more languages gives more opportunities in the future and helps them feel more confident when traveling or studying abroad.
				However, now nobody thinks about learning languages other than English or German.

			<h3>Is School Useful for Real Life?</h3>
			<p>
				The answers to the third question show that most students see school as an important place for personal development, 
				not only as a place to learn facts and theories. 
				Many students believe that school helps them grow as people and prepares them for future challenges. 
				Fourteen students (70%) say that school teaches them discipline, responsibility, and good time management. 
				They explain that homework, projects, and regular tests help them learn how to organize their day and plan their tasks better. 
				Some students say that at first this is difficult, but over time it helps them become more independent. 
				Thirteen students (65%) believe that subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology help them think logically and solve real-life problems. 
				These subjects teach students how to analyze information, look for patterns, and find correct solutions. 
				Students say that these skills are useful not only in school, but also in everyday situations. 
				Twelve students (60%) say that school prepares them to work under pressure, especially during tests, exams, and deadlines. 
				They believe that learning how to stay calm and focused in stressful situations is an important life skill. 
				At the same time, nine students (45%) think that school should teach more practical skills. 
				They mention topics such as financial education, communication skills, teamwork, and problem-solving in real-life situations. 
				Overall, students agree that school is useful, but it could become even better by combining academic knowledge with more practical learning.
