			<h2>Research on School and Education</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">
				A short research based on answers from 8th grade students
			</p>
			<p>
				School and education are very important parts of students’ lives. 
				They help young people learn new things, build skills, and prepare for the future. 
				The aim of this research is to present the opinions of 8th grade students from Sofia Mathematical High School 
				about school subjects, foreign languages, and the role of school in real life.
				The research is based on answers from 20 students from different profiles. 
				Some students study mathematics and informatics, others are in physics profiles, there are German language classes, 
				and a small group of students are more interested in natural sciences like chemistry and biology. 
				The research focuses on three main questions related to school and education.

			<h3>Most Important School Subjects</h3>
			<p>
				Mathematics is the most important subject for most students. 
				Seventeen out of twenty students (85%) included mathematics in their top three subjects. 
				They say that mathematics helps them think logically, solve problems, and understand other subjects like physics, informatics, and chemistry. 
				Informatics and Information Technologies were chosen by fourteen students (70%). 
				Students explain that programming and computer skills are very important in the modern world and will be useful in many future jobs. 
				Physics was chosen by thirteen students (65%), mainly by students from physics profiles. 
				They believe that physics helps them understand natural laws and how the world works. 
				Foreign languages were included in the top three by thirteen students (65%). 
				English is mentioned most often, but German is also important because of the language profiles in the school. 
				Bulgarian Language and Literature was chosen by twelve students (60%). 
				Students say that this subject helps them express their ideas better and understand texts more deeply. 
				Chemistry and biology were mentioned by a smaller but clear group of students. 
				Five students (25%) included chemistry and/or biology in their top three subjects. 
				These students are more interested in natural sciences and explain that chemistry and biology help them understand life, health, and the structure of matter. 
				Some of them say they are interested in medicine, pharmacy, or scientific research in the future.
